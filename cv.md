## About me 

Getting a basic education as a foreign philologist and having completed an internship in Germany, I started my career at IT company Hybrid as a corporate English trainer. During classes, I discovered a new exciting sphere from my students - frontend development. And I thought: 'It's about time to change everything'. Thus, I started studying materials on frontend development, learned about top courses in this sphere, such as RS School. Then, I consolidated my practical skills by doing a variety of freelance tasks.

Among my main personal traits, I can mention: determination, perseverance, open-mindedness and curiosity. I believe that my education and desire to constantly evolve is going to help me become a confident and high-quality developer.
